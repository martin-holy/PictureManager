                                *** BUGS ***
        # MH.UI.WPF
## Custom Window
  - minimize window will break full screen mode
## ErrorDialog
  - resize stretch

        # Picture Manager - Need Help
## VideoPlayer
  - if SpeedRatio is > 2, Pause()/Play() will cause ignoring SpeedRatio and plays on SpeedRatio = 1
    setting SpeedRatio to SpeedRatio before or after Play() doesn't help
## MediaViewer
  - app freeze on video delete when is playing

        # Picture Manager
  - read only drives and creating thumbnails
## MediaItems
  - D:\!test\364__32_original.jpg save metadata doesn't work (re-save without metadata in XnView fixed the file)
## Video Items (VideoImage and VideoClip)
  - Display aspect ratio different from video width and height ratio
    use DB width and height for aspect ratio and add way to change it
## Person Detail
  - TopSegments can get cleared when segment from not mounted drive is used and People are modified.
## MainTabs
  - creating new tab resets scroll bars on hidden tabs. probably on LayoutUpdate when ItemsSource is updated
## CollectionView
  - wrong sort (it is by text and not number) on update when grouped by date
## SegmentsMatching
  - scroll people down => select segment in segments => select person => people are scrolled to top
    maybe set focus on mouse enter


                                  *** UPDATE ***

        # MH.UI
## CollectionView
  - don't show expanded root if source is empty
  - method Add or Insert => Update(e.Data, false)


        # Picture Manager
##
  - Rethink hierarchical keywords moving
  - CoreUI with interfaces for CoreM and CoreVM
  - replace Contains with ReferenceEquals
## TreeViewCategories
  - select/mark searched item after selecting item in search result
## Keywords
  - use only one method to get keywords in which will be filtering by current viewer
## Segments
  - add button remove selected segments from drawer
## ToggleDialog
  - show selected items on dialog
## MediaItems
  - save to file only metadata visible for viewer
## MediaItemsView
  - use Filter on MediaItem type in LoadByTag GetItems
  - open items from group or all with default sort or all sorted by groups or ...?
## ProgressBarAsyncDialog
  - do Init and Start in constructor
## Core
  - use named methods for events
  - split repository and view-model events handling
    so maybe don't do events handling in EntityR but in CoreR


                                    *** NEW ***

#Shortcuts:
- ALT+S => Split video clip (create new video clip or finish selected without TimeEnd)


## DB Rewrite
  - store drive related data in drive:\Temp\PictureManagerCache\db
    (FavoriteFolders, Folders, MediaItems, Segments, VideoClips, VideoClipsGroups)
  - test before folder delete from cache if is not the db folder
  - if drive is not ready any more or if is read only => store data to default db location
  - how to load data:
    - look at X:\Temp\PictureManagerCache\db\Folders.csv
    - if not found
    - look at db\Folders.X.csv
    - if not found
    - look at db\Folders.csv
  - save needs to be done with walking the tree so that sort order is preserved
  - so the first start should load from db\Folders.csv
    and than save to X:\Temp\PictureManagerCache\db\Folders.csv or db\Folders.X.csv
    so when data was loaded from db\Folders.X.csv 
      and than there was successful save to X:\Temp\PictureManagerCache\db\Folders.csv
      db\Folders.X.csv should be deleted
  - use list of drives for load on one location
